Specifying the RMA reason when creating an RMA order is crucial for effective
inventory management, quality control, and customer service.
It helps categorize returned items accurately, identify recurring product
issues, and improve overall product quality. This data enables customer
service to address issues more effectively and enhances the customer
experience.

This addon allows RMA managers to pre-configure possible reasons users can 
specify when creating the RMA order.

In a multi-company setup, each company can define its own reasons and choose
to make the reason mandatory or optional.

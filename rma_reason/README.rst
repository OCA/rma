Specifying the RMA reason when creating an RMA order is crucial for
effective inventory management, quality control, and customer service.
It helps categorize returned items accurately, identify recurring
product issues, and improve overall product quality. This data enables
customer service to address issues more effectively and enhances the
customer experience.

This addon allows RMA managers to pre-configure possible reasons users
can specify when creating the RMA order.

In a multi-company setup, each company can define its own reasons and
choose to make the reason mandatory or optional.

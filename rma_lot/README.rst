Tracking returned products by lot or serial number is crucial for
businesses that require precise monitoring, especially in industries
where quality control, compliance, and inventory accuracy are critical.
By enabling returns to be tracked by lot or serial numbers, this module
ensures that each returned item is handled correctly, reducing the risk
of errors, fraud, or compliance issues.

This level of detail is essential for maintaining the integrity of
inventory records, meeting regulatory requirements, and providing
excellent customer service.

The module extends the existing RMA functionality by adding a lot field
to the RMA model, allowing users to associate returns with specific lot
or serial numbers. This enhancement enforces stricter controls over
return processes, ensuring that only the correct items are accepted
during a return and that inventory records remain accurate.

Tracking returned products by lot or serial number is crucial for businesses 
that require precise monitoring, especially in industries where quality control,
compliance, and inventory accuracy are critical.
By enabling returns to be tracked by lot or serial numbers, this module ensures
that each returned item is handled correctly, reducing the risk of errors,
fraud, or compliance issues.

This level of detail is essential for maintaining the integrity of inventory
records, meeting regulatory requirements, and providing excellent customer service.

The module extends the existing RMA functionality by adding a lot field to the
RMA model, allowing users to associate returns with specific lot or serial numbers.
This enhancement enforces stricter controls over return processes,
ensuring that only the correct items are accepted during a return and that
inventory records remain accurate.

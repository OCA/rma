RMA
===

The RMA can be send from the company to the customer or from the supplier to
the company

The RMA user creates the RMA and assign a responsible by selecting the
affected invoice. The available operations are refund, repair and deliver or
replace.
The assigned person checks if the conditions for the RMA are correct and
approve the RMA

The assigned person have to go to the RMA lines from the RMA and operate. THe

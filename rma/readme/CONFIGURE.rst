If you want RMAs to be created from incoming emails, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > General Settings*.
#. Check 'External Email Servers' checkbox under *Discuss* section.
#. Set an 'alias domain' and an incoming server.
#. Go to *RMA > Configuration > RMA Team* and select a team or create a new
   one.
#. Go to 'Email' tab and set an 'Email Alias'.

If you want to manually finish RMAs, you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Inventory*.
#. Set *Finish RMAs manually* checkbox on.

By default, returns to customer are grouped by shipping address, warehouse and company.
If you want to avoid this grouping you can:

#. Go to *Settings > Inventory*.
#. Set *Group RMA returns by customer address and warehouse* checkbox off.

The users will still be able to group those pickings from the wizard.

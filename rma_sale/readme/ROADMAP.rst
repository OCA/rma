* When you try to request an RMA from a Sales Order in the portal,
  a popup appears and the inputs for the quantity doesn't allow
  decimal numbers. It would be good to have a component that allows
  that and at the same time keeps the constraint of not allowing a
  number greater than the order line product quantity.

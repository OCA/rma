Getting the information as soon as possible is crucial for any business. 
That's why, when creating an RMA order from a sales order, 
it's more efficient to give the salesperson the possibility to record the 
return reason instead of waiting for the RMA team to do it when they process 
the order. This ensures accurate recording of customer issues and improves 
data accuracy.

This addon is an extension of the rma_sale and rma_reason addons. 
It allows salespersons to specify the return reason when creating the RMA 
order from the sales order.

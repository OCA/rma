Getting the information as soon as possible is crucial for any business.
That's why, when creating an RMA order from a sales order, it's more
efficient to give the salesperson the possibility to record the return
reason instead of waiting for the RMA team to do it when they process
the order. This ensures accurate recording of customer issues and
improves data accuracy.

This addon is an extension of the rma_sale and rma_reason addons. It
allows salespersons to specify the return reason when creating the RMA
order from the sales order.

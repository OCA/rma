Configuration
=============

To configure RMAs shipping strategy for your company:

#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings*
#. Choose an *RMA delivery method strategy*.
#. There are 3 possibilities:

   - Fixed method: the method will always be the same. Select it on the field *Default RMA delivery method*
     (or leave it empty for no delivery method at all).
   - Customer method: the method will be the one configured on the partner.
   - Mixed method: the method will be the one configured on the partner, otherwise
     the fixed one will be chosen.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to a RMA which has received quantities.
#. Return it to the customer.
#. Depending on your company configuration, the return picking will get one or another
   carrier.

RMA Claim Advance Location
==========================

This module adds the following location on warehouses :

 * Carrier Loss
 * RMA
 * Breakage Loss
 * Refurbish
 * Mistake Loss

And also various wizards on icoming deliveries that allow you to move your
goods easily in those new locations from a done reception.

Using this module make the logistic flow of return a bit more complexe:

 * Returning product goes into RMA location with a incoming shipment
 * From the incoming shipment, forward them to another places (stock, loss,...)

WARNING: Use with caution, this module is currently not yet completely debugged
and is waiting his author to be.

To use this module, you need to:

#. Make a a sale order with a kit on it and deliver its components.
#. Go to the portal view for the order and launch the RMA wizard.
#. You'll see a line for the kit.
#. There will be a limit of kits to return that should much the number of kits
   delivered.
#. Once you validate the wizard with the number of kits to deliver, you'll
   have as many RMAs as components those kits have with the proper quantities
   for each one.
#. If you refund the components, the kit in the sale line will be used as the
   reference.

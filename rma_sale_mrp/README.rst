This module enables RMAs for kits, wich isn't compatible with the base modules.
In the backend side, we can return separate component while in the frontend
side, customers can return the whole kit and the proper RMAs will be generated.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Make a a sale order with a kit on it and deliver its components.
#. Go to the portal view for the order and launch the RMA wizard.
#. You'll see a line for the kit.
#. There will be a limit of kits to return that should much the number of kits
   delivered.
#. Once you validate the wizard with the number of kits to deliver, you'll
   have as many RMAs as components those kits have with the proper quantities
   for each one.
#. If you refund the components, the kit in the sale line will be used as the
   reference.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

We compute the kits from the original demanded quantity in the sale order. If
this quantity was to change, we could loose the right components per kit
reference. So this should be very present. Also, v12 has a very poor support
for delivered quantities, that is very improved in v13 with the introduction
of the link to the BoM line in the stock moves. That approach could lead to
errors as well, as the BoM line could change in the future loosing again the
original components per kit reference. Anyway, is to be considered in that
version to use the same rules so they fail for the same reasons.

Some extra features would be nice to have:

* Add actions constraints to disallow actions on single components.
* Show kit components in the portal wizard.
* Allow to make an RMA directly from a kit product.
